Required Software:

- Python 3.10.2 (with global PATH enabled)
- Java JDK 17
- JAVA JRE 8 (64bit)

Required Python Libraries:

- xlwt
- xlrd
- pandas
- pygame

Instructions:

1. Open uSpectrum and connect the UPRtek devicc. Ensure that it has been dark calibration.
2. Enter the "View" menu
3. Launch DataCollection.py or DataCollection.pyw (headless start version) to run the program.
4. A GUI will appear. It will allow you to set the current ID or to start a testing run.
5. Upon starting the testing run ensure that the Java CMD window is not obstruction the capture button.
6. The program will begin testing through the patterns and alert you when finished.
7. Swap out the LED ensuring to disconnect the 48V before swapping it

Unusual Behaviour:

- Almost "Missing the phase" or "Missing the phase":
When uSpectrum is delayed and is recording light readings at the edge of the window this is often due to slow hardware.
The most likely scenario is an overheating device that is being thermally handicapped and can be solved by letting
the device cool.

- Immediate Crashing of the Python Window:
The most likely cause of this is a COM port error. This can be solved by reconnecting the COM port port to the computer.

- Stuck LED
Press the reset button on the ESP32 to reset the LED. Starting the script will also reset the LED.
